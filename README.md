# Statistical Analysis of Animal Shelter Data using R
## DSC 520 - Statistics for Data Science - Final Project

The objective of this project was to demonstrate knowledge of a statistical analysis workflow using the R programming language to address a problem with data science.  Results of the analysis are presented in a markdown report.  

### Abstract
The animal welfare community is divided by the “no-kill” movement. Despite the good intentions of the advocates to transition shelters to a goal of zero animals euthanzied, they have actually created a negative public perceptions of excellent open admission shelters simply trying to keep up with the flow of animals entering their doors. The fact in many communities is that the rate at which animals are entering shelters is far greater than the rate at which they are being placed into homes. To simply stop the euthanasia of animals in shelters causes further problems of overcrowding, illness and poor quality of life for the animals. So how do you move towards a “no-kill” or low euthanasia rate facility while keeping the health and safety of the animal in mind?

My goal was to use data from a Austin Animal Center Shelter Intakes and Outcomes, a shelter with already low euthanasia rates, to find insights that could help other shelters struggling to improve upon their euthanasia rates. Questions explored include:
-	Do cats or dogs have a higher likelihood of live release/euthanasia?
-	Do older animals have a higher or lower likelihood of live release/euthanasia?
-	For dogs, does breed play a role in a shelter dog’s outcome?
-	Does the condition of the animal upon intake affect the outcome?
-	Does the intake type affect the outcome?
-	Does the gender of the animal affect the outcome?
-	As the length of the animals stay in the shelter increases, does the chance of live release decrease? Does the chance of euthanasia increase?
